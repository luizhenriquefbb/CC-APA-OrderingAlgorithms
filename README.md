# cc-APA-SortingAlgorithms
An APA activity.
A simple project that sorts a list of numbers.

So far, this activity has been divided into following stages:
- inserion sort and selection sort
- merge and quick sort
- heapify and heapSort
- counting sort and radix sort

## How to use
place a file named "couting.txt" in the file project and enter the following command in the cmd or terminal
```sh
java -jar OrderingAlgorithms.jar
```

## Obs:
Radix sort does not suport files containing negative numbers. So I decided throw an Exception.
